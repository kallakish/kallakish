I hope you are doing well.

As part of our ongoing DevOps organization cleanup, we need to review the last activity of various organizations to determine their usage status. We recently raised a request with Microsoft regarding this, and they have recommended that we obtain Project Collection Admin access to proceed with the necessary assessments.

Given this guidance, I would like to request your approval to be assigned the Project Collection Admin role. This will enable us to effectively gather insights and proceed with the cleanup as advised.

Please let me know if you need any further details. Looking forward to your confirmation.
