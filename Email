Subject: Request for VM Setup Details for Azure Fabric Gateway and ADF Integration Runtime

Hi Patrick,

I hope you're doing well.

Iâ€™m from the Data Engineering team and was looking into setting up a VM for the Azure Fabric Gateway and ADF Integration Runtime, where the VM would be able to connect to on-premises database servers and ingest data into the Azure cloud.

Debbie mentioned that you have already completed the initial VM setup as per the email below. Could you please let me know if we can get the setup details? I would also like to confirm if the VM is ready and suitable for use with our Azure Fabric and ADF requirements.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks and regards,
