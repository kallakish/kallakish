Naming Conventions for Microsoft Fabric (Medallion Architecture) - Template
This template is designed to help you establish clear, consistent, and understandable naming conventions for your Microsoft Fabric data platform, particularly for a metadata-driven Medallion architecture.

1. General Principles
Clarity & Readability: Names should be descriptive and easy to understand.
Consistency: Apply the chosen convention uniformly across all Fabric items.
Case: Define your preferred casing (e.g., PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE) for:
Fabric Items (Workspaces, Lakehouses, Warehouses, Pipelines, Dataflows, Notebooks): [Your_Casing_Convention_xxxxx]
Lakehouse/Warehouse Tables & Columns: [Your_Casing_Convention_xxxxx]
Prefixes/Suffixes: Determine if and how you will use prefixes (e.g., for layers, item types) and suffixes (e.g., for actions, frequencies).
Abbreviations: Establish and document a list of standard abbreviations.
Delimiters: Choose your standard delimiter (e.g., _, -) for separating components in names. [Your_Delimiter_Choice_xxxxx]
Conciseness: Aim for descriptive yet reasonably short names, being mindful of any character limits within Fabric.
2. Common Abbreviations

Convention: [Your_Convention_Here_xxxxx]
Silver Lakehouse Tables (Delta Tables):
Dimension Table Convention: [Your_Convention_Here_xxxxx]
Fact Table Convention: [Your_Convention_Here_xxxxx]
Other Table Convention: [Your_Convention_Here_xxxxx]
Schema (within Lakehouse): [Your_Schema_Name_Convention_xxxxx]
7. Data Transformation (Silver Lakehouse -> Gold Data Warehouse)
Pipelines (PL):
Specific Mart/Aggregate Convention: [Your_Convention_Here_xxxxx]
