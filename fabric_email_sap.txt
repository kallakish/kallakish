Hi <Admin Name>,

We’re setting up Microsoft Fabric (Data Factory) to extract data from SAP using the SAP Table connector via our On-premises Data Gateway. The gateway is failing with:

“The assembly sapnco could not be found, please ensure the SAP Connector for Microsoft .NET 3.0 is installed in your GAC…”

To resolve this, we need the SAP .NET Connector (NCo) installed on the gateway server (64-bit) and added to the Windows GAC.

Could you please either:

Provide me an SAP Support Portal user with Software Download authorization (S-user), or

Download the installer on our behalf and share it internally:

SAP Connector for Microsoft .NET (NCo) 3.1, 64-bit for Windows (includes sapnco.dll / sapnco_utils.dll)

Once downloaded, we will install it on the gateway machine(s) and restart the gateway service.

Thanks,
