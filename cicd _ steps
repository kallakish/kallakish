ðŸ”¹ 10-Step CICD Pipeline Flow

1. Code Development

Developers create feature branches, implement changes, commit, and push code.

2. Merge & Build

Code is peer-reviewed, merged into main/master, and the pipeline prepares build artifacts (packages, Fabric items, SQL scripts, etc.).

3. Deploy to Dev

Build artifacts are automatically deployed to the Dev environment.

4. Validate in Dev

Developers perform unit tests / smoke tests in Dev to ensure functionality.

5. Deploy to Test

If Dev validation passes, code is promoted and deployed to the Test environment.

6. Verify in Test

The test team (or automated regression tests) validate the solution against requirements.

7. Deploy to UAT

Once Test verification succeeds, code is promoted and deployed to the UAT environment.

8. Validate in UAT

Business users (UAT team) validate functionality and sign off.

9. Deploy to Live (Prod)

After UAT acceptance, the release is promoted and deployed to the Live environment.

10. Post-Deployment Verification

Smoke tests, monitoring, and validation are performed in Live to confirm stability.
